                <img id="profilepic" src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/AAEAAQAAAAAAAArzAAAAJGExMmZhNDJhLTgzZGUtNGI3My1hYTRmLWIwMThjMjlkZWQ5NA.jpg" alt="My Bio Pic">
                <p>I was born in California but moved when I was very young to Philadelphia (Go Eagles!).</p>
                <p>When I turned 18, I knew I was ready to be "going going, back back, to Cali Cali" (R.I.P. Biggie Smalls).</p>
                <p>I moved away from the east coast to attend California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. And if you are a big Operah fan, she quoted that city "the happiest city in America".</p>
                <p>And she is 100% right!! The city is located in a breathtaking crevice of the green rolling foothills, and backs up right to the most beautiful beaches you have ever laid eyes on.</p>
                <p>Cal Poly SLO, for short, is where I earned my B.S. in Business with a concentration in Human Resources and Management.</p>
                <p>I stayed in SLO to work full time at a software company, Mindbody Inc. for about a year in the HR Department, and then decided to move to Texas!</p>
                <p>I moved to Dallas to work for the Topgolf Corporate Office and absolutely love it. I have been with Topgolf for almost two years and it is a phenomenal organization.</p>
                <p>And the city of Dallas is a blast - the town culture is fun and engaging, with a plethera of great bars and restaurants.</p>
                <p>And that's my (short version) of my life story! Have fun exploring the page and more fun facts about moi. </p>
